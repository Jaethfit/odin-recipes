Module 1 practice project with The Odin Project

This is a project with The Odin Project that demonstrates some basic HTML 
formatting as well as some git commands.  In this project, I will show my 
proficiency with creating repositories, cloning, commiting, and pushing 
projects to github. I will also be demonstrating proper code formatting 
and error debugging.
